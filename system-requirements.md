# Hardware Requirements 

## To get points you need to put into a tier (currently ranging from best to worst as 1-5).

Each tier has some required models that you need to download and register to the network and certain amounts of GPU memory:

- `1` : `30GB`
- `2` : `20GB`
- `3` : `8GB`
- `4` : `4GB`
- `5` : `2GB`

You can see what models you need by attempting to `hive select-tier` or by running `hive allocate` with the amount of VRAM you want to provide.
